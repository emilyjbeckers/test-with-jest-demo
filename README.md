# Building Meaningful Tests in React Native

Demo code to go along with my presentation at the [React Native meetup in San Francisco 8/21/2019](https://www.meetup.com/React-Native-San-Francisco/events/263627171/)

## Talk Description

Just about everybody would agree that writing good unit tests results in a better codebase; the act of writing the tests helps make sure that edge cases are covered and that code is written in clean, testable pieces, and down the line, they can catch regressions. In this talk, I'll introduce the Jest testing library and then use it to get one hundred percent test coverage on an example component. Along the way we will talk about async testing, mocks, and spies, and discuss how to build your test suites so that the results are still meaningful next week and beyond.
